# SprintsAI-Task1-
Project: AI ServiceNow Support Assistant
Sprint: BARQ G3 - Sprint 1 (S1.1) - Platform Administration & Security Governance
Deliverable: Integration_Agent Configuration Note

Note regarding the `snc_internal` role:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
As per the mentor's guidance:
"snc_internal requires the Explicit Roles plugin (com.glide.explicit_roles), which we were instructed not to activate in our PDI to avoid potential system-wide ACL access disruptions."

Accordingly, the Integration_Agent account has been provisioned following the least-privilege security standard using the required API role:
- rest_service (Active)
- snc_required_script_writer_permission (Inherited)
- No admin privileges assigned.
